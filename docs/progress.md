Had compatibility issues with python versions. Impact on ORB SLAM3 dependencies due to multiple co-existing python versions<br/>-Tried running on a VM(Ubuntu 20). Basic run successful. But crahes and tracking freezes inconsistently.<br/>-tried to run on Ubuntu 20. Having issues with ROS node compilation. <br/>-Melodic not supported on 20. Neotic is supported. But ORB SLAM3<br/>-depends on pythininterp 2.7 but neotic needs > 3<br/>Next step is to downgrade to Ubuntu 18	</font>|

|<font size=2>	1	</font>|	<font size=2>	AKAZE vs ORB	</font>|	<font size=2>	Make a strong case for motivation as to why AKAZE was chosen	</font>|	<font size=2>	Done	</font>|	<font size=2>	ORB is faster, but AKAZE is better - AKAZE has Better matching and is Scale invariant. ORB is not scale invariant. AKAZE performs well with low resolution images (640x480). Performance drops with higher resolution. Probably due to non linear scale space.<br/>if we have AKAZE working in real time , then even if there is ORB in HW acceleration, if real time speed is achieved, then AKAZE would be the winner. Bcos if I have real time performance doesnâ€™t matter if it is few nanoseconds slower. But need proof for this.<br/>Can we compare HW based AKAZE with SW based ORB.<br/>is there Hardware based ORB that can be used for comparison<br/>AKAZE is always only preferred for low resolution and not for high resolution<br/>Bottlenose is HD camera, how do we justify this ?<br/>there is HW accelerated ORB. <br/>[paper1](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9651662) <br/> [paper2](https://upcommons.upc.edu/bitstream/handle/2117/176803/144679.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y#:~:text=by%20Ra%C3%BAl%20TARANCO,an%20agent's%20location%20within%20it.) <br/> ORB has also improved by adding scale invariance.<br/>[paper1](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3297156.3297184)</font>|
